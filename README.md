# Call-Center-Performance-Efficiency-Analysis-CallMeMaybe-
Analyse call-center operational data to identify inefficiencies, missed calls, and performance drivers, and provide actionable recommendations to improve service quality.

## 1. Overview
This project analyses operational data from **CallMeMaybe**, a virtual call-center service, to evaluate operator efficiency, identify missed-call patterns, and improve overall service quality.

The analysis combines exploratory data analysis with KPI evaluation and an interactive dashboard to support operational decision-making.

---

## 2. Business Objective
- Evaluate call-center performance using operational KPIs  
- Identify inefficiencies and high missed-call rates  
- Compare operator workload and performance  
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer experience  

---

## 3. Live Dashboard (Tableau Public)
An interactive dashboard was built to support daily monitoring and stakeholder access:

The dashboard allows users to:
- Monitor missed vs answered calls
- Compare operator efficiency
- Identify peak demand periods
- Support operational decisions with visual insights

---

## 4. Data
The dataset includes call-center operational records such as:
- Call timestamps
- Call duration
- Call status (answered / missed)
- Operator identifiers

Data is cleaned and standardised to ensure reliable analysis.

---

## 5. Analytical Workflow
### Data Preparation
- Load and clean call logs
- Convert timestamps and validate data types
- Remove incomplete or invalid records

### Exploratory Analysis
- Call volume trends over time
- Distribution of call durations
- Missed vs answered call ratios
- Operator workload comparison

### Performance Metrics
- Missed call rate
- Average handling time
- Calls handled per operator
- Identification of overloaded or underperforming operators

---

## 6. Key Outputs
- KPI tables and visualisations
- Identification of performance gaps
- Operator-level insights
- Interactive Tableau dashboard
- Operational improvement recommendations

---

## 7. Tools
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib / plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Tableau Public  

---

## 8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how operational data can be transformed into actionable insights to improve call-center efficiency, reduce missed calls, and enhance customer experience.
